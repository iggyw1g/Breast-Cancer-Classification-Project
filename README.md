## About The Project

The goal of this project is to accurately predict whether a breast cancer tumor is **malignant** or **benign** based on a set of digitized image features. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for patient outcomes, making this a vital application of machine learning.

This project walks through the entire data science workflow, including:

- **Loading and cleaning** the dataset.
- **Exploring and visualizing** the data to understand feature relationships.
- **Training and comparing** three distinct classification models.
- **Evaluating** the models with a focus on metrics that are critical for medical diagnoses, such as **Recall**.

The ultimate objective is to identify the most effective and reliable model for this classification task.

## Analysis Overview

- üìä **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed initial analysis to understand the data distribution and used correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between features.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Feature Engineering & Selection:** Analyzed different subsets of features (mean, worst) and used Random Forest's built-in feature importance to identify the most predictive variables.
- üß† **Model Training:** Implemented and trained three powerful classification models:
  1.  **Logistic Regression**
  2.  **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  3.  **Random Forest Classifier**
- üìà **Model Evaluation:** Performed a robust evaluation using K-Fold Cross-Validation, Confusion Matrices, and a detailed Classification Report. The primary focus was on maximizing the recall for malignant cases (Class 1) to minimize dangerous false negatives.

## Tech Stack

This project was developed entirely in Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need Python 3 and Pip installed on your system.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/iggyw1g/MLProj
   ```
2. **Navigate into the project directory:**
   ```sh
   cd MLProj
   ```
3. **Install the required libraries:**
   - It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
   ```sh
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy scikit-learn jupyter
   ```
4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook finalproject.ipynb
   ```

## Results

After a comprehensive evaluation of all three models, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel was identified as the top-performing model.

- SVM (Linear Kernel): Achieved the best balance of precision and recall, demonstrating a strong ability to distinguish between malignant and benign tumors with high confidence. The linear nature of the model suggests that the feature space is largely linearly separable.
- Random Forest: Also performed exceptionally well, providing a robust model and valuable insights through its feature importance scores.
- Logistic Regression: Served as a strong baseline but was ultimately outperformed by the more complex ensemble and margin-based models.

The final conclusion emphasizes the importance of recall for malignant cases, where the SVM model proved highly effective, successfully identifying 93% of all malignant tumors in the test set.
